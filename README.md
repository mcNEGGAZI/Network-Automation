## Overview : 

This project focuses on automating network operations by implementing specific solutions for Cisco devices. Currently, we utilize Python libraries such as Netmiko, Paramiko, and NAPALM to connect, configure, and manage Cisco equipment efficiently and consistently. However, it is worth noting that additional libraries may be explored in the future to address specific needs or leverage new technological advancements in the field of network automation.

The primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency and reduce human errors associated with manual configuration and management of network devices. Automation also enables increased scalability and centralized management of network infrastructures, contributing to the modernization and optimization of computer networks.

This project is scalable, and regular updates will be made to existing scripts as it progresses. Future enhancements will include adding additional features, optimizing code, and integrating new libraries and automation techniques.

Ultimately, the ultimate goal is to create a web-based network monitoring platform that leverages existing automation scripts. This platform will provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing network devices, offering real-time operational data, alerts, and detailed reports to facilitate decision-making and performance optimization of network infrastructure.
